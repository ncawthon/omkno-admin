# Growth Lead

The Growth Lead is the public-facing persona behind Omkno's products. They will be responsible for growing and maintaining a community of passionate, engaged members. This position will act as the initial point-of-contact for both traditional and modern media outlets, responding as needed to inquiries from both customers and press. The Growth Lead should be able to evangelize the merits of Omkno's products and recite the science behind the reasons for their inception.

The Growth Lead will not be expected to do everything themselves, instead being able to find and prioritize and resources with complimentary skill sets as needed. As Omkno grows, so will the staff and permanency of the individuals assisting the Growth Lead's efforts.
